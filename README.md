## 🚩 Problem Statement

Indian street food vendors face daily challenges in sourcing ingredients from reliable sources.  
Unorganized supply chains lead to wasted time, higher costs, and inconsistent quality.

## 💡 Our Solution

Our platform bridges the gap between street food vendors and trusted local suppliers. It allows vendors to:

- 🔍 Search for **verified suppliers** of essential raw materials  
- 💬 View **details, pricing, and reviews** for each supplier  
- 🛒 Add items to cart and simulate **bulk order placing**  
- 📲 Use a clean, mobile-first UI designed for quick access and ease of use  

We’ve created a working frontend prototype and structure for backend/serverless logic using Netlify Functions.
